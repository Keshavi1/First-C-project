# First-C-project


I started learning C around 2 weeks ago and this was the main project I used to learn. I gotta say, C is so difficult, yet so satisfying st the same time.

Anyway, the project is basiclly a program that lets you create a list of items in the teminal and save it to a .txt file.  

p.s. if a C profesonal sees this, can you tell me if I used pointers and the memory allocs correctly. 
I think I used them right, but i only started using them a week ago, so my thoughts can't be trusted.
